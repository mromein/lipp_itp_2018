## Live Image Processing and Performance  ::  ITP Spring 2018

This is the code repository for the Live Image Processing and Performance Class at ITP. Each week has its own folder with different code examples pertaining to what was covered in class. There is also a cheat sheet folder that has some patches containing a quick overview of different objects. 

All files are Max patches (.maxpat) which can be run using Max 7.3.4
 
Video tutorials based off the patches from this repo are hosted on [my Youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPWF2lJ4E_qVG7HrWRiGnhA/playlists)

All patches developed by Matt Romein
